<p className="pb-4 max-w-[60%] py-5 text-lg leading-7">Today is a big day for web designers and developers everywhere. I'm excited to share Easy UI with you all. This project is all about changing how we do web design, making it simpler, more efficient, and accessible. Easy UI brings you over 50 free website templates. These aren't just any templates. We've put a lot of work into them, using the latest tech like React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind Labs CSS, Shadcn-UI, and Framer Motion. We made sure they're top-notch in both looks and performance.</p>

<p className="pb-4 max-w-[60%] py-5 text-lg leading-7">Getting these 50+ free website templates ready was a huge task. We spent many hours on design, development, and testing. We wanted to make sure each template was perfect on all devices and platforms. Our aim was to give web designers and developers a set of tools that would save them a lot of time and money.</p>

<p className="pb-4 max-w-[60%] py-5 text-lg leading-7">I'm thrilled to release the first three templates from our collection today:</p>
